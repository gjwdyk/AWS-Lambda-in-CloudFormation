# AWS Lambda within AWS CloudFormation

This Repository is a collection of some notes of a learning journey on how to do AWS Lambda Function from within AWS CloudFormation Stack/Template.
Most of the learning item notes are accompanied with working sample code.

<br>

There are at least two ways to incorporate Lambda Function into CloudFormation Template :
- [ ] [InLine](InLine/)
- [ ] [Lambda source code located in AWS S3 Bucket](S3Bucket/)

<br>

This Repository covers only the Skeleton of how to :
- [ ] Transfer information/input from CloudFormation to Lambda,
- [ ] Transfer information/output from Lambda to CloudFormation,
- [ ] Glue both CloudFormation and Lambda together,
- [ ] Using only NodeJS as the language at the Lambda Function,
- [ ] Call External API Service (example: on the Internet).

<br>

Other aspects of Lambda are not covered.
