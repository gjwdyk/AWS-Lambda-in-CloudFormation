# AWS Lambda within AWS CloudFormation

This Repository is only a collection of some notes of a learning journey on how to do AWS Lambda Function from within AWS CloudFormation Stack/Template.



There are at least two ways to incorporate Lambda Function into CloudFormation Template:
- [ ] [InLine](InLine/)
- [ ] Separated, where the Lambda Function is stored in AWS S3



This Repository covers only the Skeleton of how to
- [ ] transfer information/input from CloudFormation to Lambda,
- [ ] transfer information/output from Lambda to CloudFormation,
- [ ] glueing both CloudFormation and Lambda together

Other more advanced aspects of Lambda most probably won't be covered.
